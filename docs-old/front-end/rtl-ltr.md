## RTL via SASS

[phenix sass](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/sass-overview/)Â has two main filesÂ phenix-rtl.scssÂ andÂ phenix.scssÂ and those files is what gets compiled and watch by the npm sass script each of that file possess only the Fonts & Text direction for more information about building sass go back toÂ [Build Tools](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/build-tools/)Â document.

```
ğŸ’¼-your-project[phenix]
    ğŸ“‚-src/sass
        ğŸ“„phenix.scss || LTR Options
        ğŸ“„phenix-rtl.scssâ €|| RTL Options
        ğŸ“„...
```

## Logical Classes

Phenix CSSÂ [utilities](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/category/utilities/) and class names for anything that is related to flow direction fromÂ topÂ toÂ bottomÂ andÂ leftÂ toÂ right, orÂ right toÂ left depending on what language the document is, phenix uses the new CSS conceptÂ [Logical Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties)Â for naming classes for example:

letâ€™s assume your document language is English which means your main Block flow is from the document Top to Bottom and the Inline Flow is Left to Right, but we do not use those terms anymore, in phenix, the classes are named logically in this case of ours Left meansÂ StartÂ and Right meansÂ EndÂ which leads us to classes like,

for example,Â tx-align-startÂ to align text to the left in case of LTR and to the right in case of RTL, another example isÂ tx-align-endÂ to align text to the right in case of LTR and to the left in case of RTL.

and for properties that go both ways you will find class names likeÂ gpx-\*Â to create even space betweenÂ [columns](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/columns/)Â horizontally insideÂ [grid](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/category/grid-layout/)Â orÂ [flexbox](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/flexbox-grid/)Â layouts and also class names likeÂ gpy-\*Â to create even space betweenÂ [columns](https://phenixthemes.com/pds-docs/columns/)Â vertically,

## Conclusion

top and bottom are referred to asÂ class-t-\* orÂ class-tp-\*Â andÂ class-b-\*Â orÂ class-bt-\*Â andÂ YÂ for both, alsoÂ left & rightÂ is referred to asÂ startÂ andÂ endÂ orÂ X for both
