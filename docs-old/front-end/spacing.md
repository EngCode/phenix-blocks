## Spacing

Phenix includes a wide range of shorthand responsive margin, padding, utilities classes to modify an elementâ€™s appearance.

## Padding [](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding)Utilities

phenix provide a range of shorthand [responsive](http://phenix.localhost/test/responsive-break-points/) `padding` classes you can set a `padding` for individual properties, all properties, and vertical and horizontal properties with a [responsive breakpoint](http://phenix.localhost/test/responsive-break-points/) to begin with like any other responsive [utilities](http://phenix.localhost/test/category/utilities/) you add `-{breakpoint}` after the utility prefix for example `.pd-md-*` to add padding to the element for the medium screens size and up,

in the table below you can learn the pattern for each class name and its available values.

| Class name | Description | Markup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `` `.pd-*` `` | add padding for all direction. | `<any>` |
