## Block Patterns

we all know you can create block patterns from the editor, but one thing missing that makes pattern looks bad in the preview is defining a fixed width for the pattern for the preview, and Phenix Blocks solve this problem with the Block Patterns tool in the Data collection, which you can use to create pattern by just copy/paste the blocks from the editor into the pattern content.
