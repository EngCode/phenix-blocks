## Custom Post-Types

in the Post Types tab, you can create or edit the Type of Content your website has, for example you have the blog by default, in your theme you might also have Service content type or Products Content type etc.

you can create new content type and then Design a dynamic Archive and Single Templates from the Site Editor, using the Main Template Parts of your website and Any of our Dynamic Blocks like the Posts Query.
