# Interactive Utilities

The Interactive utilities in the Phenix Design System encompass a range of CSS classes designed to add dynamic behavior and visual feedback to your user interface elements. These utilities cover effects that respond to user actions (like hover) or enhance the visual presentation with motion and transformations.

This section includes utilities for:

-   [**Effects**](./effects.md): Apply animations, transformations, and highlight effects to elements, either continuously or on interaction.
-   [**Transitions**](./transitions.md): Control the timing and smoothness of CSS property changes.
-   [**Scroll Effects**](./scroll-effects.md): Influence scrolling behavior, such as implementing scroll snapping.
-   [**Mouse Interaction**](./mouse-interaction.md): Control cursor appearance and pointer events.
-   [**Loading Indicators**](./loading-indicators.md): Show loading or processing states.

These utilities are designed to be combined with each other and with base element styles to create engaging and responsive user experiences.
