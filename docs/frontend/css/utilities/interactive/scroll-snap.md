# Scroll Effects

Scroll effect utilities in the Phenix Design System modify the scrolling behavior of elements or containers.

## Overview

The primary scroll effect currently available is Scroll Snap.

## Scroll Snap

Scroll snapping allows you to create scrollable containers where the viewport locks onto specific points or elements as the user scrolls.

```html
<!-- Create a container with scroll snapping -->
<div class="px-section-snap">
  <div class="section">Section 1</div>
  <div class="section">Section 2</div>
  <div class="section">Section 3</div>
</div>
```

The `.px-section-snap` class applies the necessary CSS properties (`scroll-snap-type` and potentially `scroll-snap-align` to children) to enable scroll snapping within the container.

### Usage

Scroll snap is useful for:

-   Image carousels or galleries
-   Full-page section scrolling
-   Step-by-step wizards or tutorials

### Customization

Scroll snap behavior can be further customized with standard CSS properties like `scroll-snap-align`, `scroll-padding`, etc., applied directly to the container or its children.

## Best Practices

1.  **Ensure sufficient content**: Scroll snap works best when there is clearly enough content to scroll through.
2.  **Provide clear visual cues**: Indicate to users that the area is scrollable and uses snapping.
3.  **Test usability**: Ensure the snapping behavior feels natural and doesn't hinder navigation.
4.  **Consider alternatives**: For complex interactions, a JavaScript-based slider or carousel might offer more control.

## Responsive Scroll Effects

The `.px-section-snap` utility does not have built-in responsive variants. Its behavior is consistent across all screen sizes. To enable or disable scroll snapping at different breakpoints, you would need to conditionally add or remove the class using JavaScript or apply custom CSS with media queries.
