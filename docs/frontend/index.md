# Front-End Development Overview

This section covers all the front-end aspects of the Phenix Design System, including SASS framework, TypeScript utilities, UI components, and more.

## Phenix Ecosystem

Phenix Design System is available in two distinct packages:

1. **phenix-ui**: The standalone front-end framework that can be used with any project or CMS
2. **pds-blocks**: The complete WordPress plugin that includes the front-end framework plus Gutenberg blocks integration

The documentation in this section primarily focuses on the front-end framework, which is common to both packages. **For WordPress-specific features, please refer to the [WordPress Documentation section](/wordpress/).**

## Core Modules

### UI Components
Pre-built components like alerts, buttons, modals, and navigation systems.

### Form Controls
Form input elements, validation, and advanced form components.

### Helpers & Tools
Additional utilities for performance optimization, icons, effects, and more.
