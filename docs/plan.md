## Refactoring the Docs

- [ ] Review the existing documentation and identify areas for improvement
- [ ] Refactor the documentation to align with the plan
- [ ] Ensure consistency in terminology and style
- [ ] Update code examples and visual aids
- [ ] Verify accuracy and completeness of the documentation

## Fact-Checking Process

For each documentation section, we follow this process:

1. **Review Live Documentation**: Examine the existing documentation at phenixthemes.com
2. **Source Code Analysis**: Review the corresponding source code:
   - For phenix-ui: Check the GitHub repository
   - For pds-blocks: Check the repository structure and code
3. **Cross-Verification**: Ensure documentation matches implementation
4. **Testing**: Verify code examples work as expected
5. **Update Documentation**: Write clear, accurate documentation with:
   - Conceptual explanations
   - Code examples
   - Visual aids where appropriate
   - Links to related sections

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation:

1. Focus on one section at a time
2. Always verify information against source code
3. Maintain consistent style and terminology
4. Use clear, concise language
5. Include practical examples
6. Consider both beginner and advanced users
7. Reference source code line numbers where helpful

## Quality Standards

All documentation must meet these standards:

- Factually accurate and verified
- Clear and accessible language
- Properly formatted code examples
- Consistent terminology
- Logical organization
- Helpful cross-references
- Complete coverage of features

## Progress Tracking

We'll track progress through each phase, marking completed sections and identifying any sections requiring additional work or review.

## Timeline
