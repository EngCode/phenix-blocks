# Phenix Design System Documentation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive documentation for the Phenix Design System. We're building a new VitePress-based documentation system that will replace the current live documentation.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is divided into two main sections, reflecting the two distinct packages:

1. **Frontend Documentation**: Covers the standalone front-end framework (phenix-ui)
2. **WordPress Documentation**: Covers the WordPress integration and blocks (pds-blocks)

## Methodology

Our documentation approach follows these principles:

1. **Section-by-Section Development**: We tackle one logical section at a time, ensuring completeness before moving to the next
2. **Dual-Source Fact Checking**: All documentation is verified against:
   - The existing live documentation at phenixthemes.com
   - The actual source code in the repositories
3. **Clear Separation**: We clearly distinguish between the standalone framework and WordPress plugin
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: We start with basic installation and work toward more complex topics
5. **Code Examples**: All documentation includes practical, tested code examples
6. **Cross-Referencing**: Where appropriate, we link between related sections

## Fact-Checking Process

For each documentation section, we follow this process:

1. **Review Live Documentation**: Examine the existing documentation at phenixthemes.com
2. **Source Code Analysis**: Review the corresponding source code:
   - For phenix-ui: Check the GitHub repository
   - For pds-blocks: Check the repository structure and code
3. **Cross-Verification**: Ensure documentation matches implementation
4. **Testing**: Verify code examples work as expected
5. **Update Documentation**: Write clear, accurate documentation with:
   - Conceptual explanations
   - Code examples
   - Visual aids where appropriate
   - Links to related sections

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation:

1. Focus on one section at a time
2. Always verify information against source code
3. Maintain consistent style and terminology
4. Use clear, concise language
5. Include practical examples
6. Consider both beginner and advanced users
7. Reference source code line numbers where helpful

## Quality Standards

All documentation must meet these standards:

- Factually accurate and verified
- Clear and accessible language
- Properly formatted code examples
- Consistent terminology
- Logical organization
- Helpful cross-references
- Complete coverage of features

## Progress Tracking

We'll track progress through each phase, marking completed sections and identifying any sections requiring additional work or review.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Completed
- **Phase 2**: In progress (Quick Start section completed, Working with SASS next)
- **Phases 3-7**: To be scheduled based on progress

## Next Steps

1. Complete the "Working with SASS" section
2. Begin the "Working with TypeScript" section
3. Proceed to CSS Modules documentation
