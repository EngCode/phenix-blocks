# Theme Customizing

Before diving into customization, it's important to be familiar with some WordPress concepts and terms as a content editor. This guide will help you effectively customize your website using the Phenix Design System.

## Site Editor

The Site Editor is the new interface introduced in WordPress v5.8 that allows you to customize dynamic pages for different content types. For example, you can modify:

- Archive pages for Posts or Services
- The main layout of the website
- Dynamic pages like blog posts or service pages

The Site Editor is based on the block (or component) design system, where small components come together to build something new.

You can find all Phenix Blocks in the Design Category of the Blocks List from the Editor.

## Color Schema

The styles and colors of your website theme can be customized from the Site Editor Styles panel. When you select it, you'll access the editor with a style panel opened in the sidebar. From there, you can edit the colors of the website.

## Site Templates

Templates in the Site Editor allow you to customize dynamic pages like Archives and Single Post pages.

## Patterns and Template Parts

### Block Patterns

Block Patterns are pre-designed templates that you can add to your content and edit as needed. They can be used across both the Block Editor and the Site Editor. Another type of Block Pattern is the Synced Pattern, which will update everywhere it's used, similar to a Template Part.

### Template Parts

Template Parts are components that can be used in the Templates of the Site Editor as shared content sections. Examples include the header or footer of your website that can be changed from one place - the Template Part itself.

## Multi-Language Support

If you have a multi-language theme and plugin installed, make sure your Template Parts and Synced Patterns are translated and have all languages installed.

## Block Editor

The Block Editor (introduced in WordPress v5.0) is what you'll use most frequently to write your content when adding new blog posts, services, or other content types. You'll find all Phenix Blocks in the Design Category of the Blocks List.

The Block Editor has three main areas:

1. **Content Area**: The large area where your content appears
2. **Top Bar**: Contains quick controls and options for any part of the content you're currently selecting
3. **Sidebar**: Shows the current post/page dynamic data options and settings for the selected content element

At the bottom, you'll also find a navigation bar that shows where you're focused in the content and allows you to navigate back to parent elements.

## Classic Editor

You'll rarely encounter the Classic Editor in the Phenix Design System. When you do, it will typically be related to pure dynamic data implementation, such as WooCommerce Products or similar features that depend on dynamic data and options for search and filtering.

As a familiar interface, the Classic Editor is straightforward - simply follow the form fields and fill in the available data when you encounter it.

## Advanced Customization

### Custom CSS

For more advanced customization, you can add custom CSS to your theme:

1. Go to **Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS**
2. Add your custom CSS code
3. Preview the changes in real-time
4. Save when satisfied

### Template Editing

You can create custom templates for specific pages or post types:

1. In the Site Editor, click on **Templates**
2. Click **Add New** to create a new template
3. Select the template type (single post, page, archive, etc.)
4. Build your template using blocks
5. Save and publish when complete

### Block Variations

Many Phenix blocks offer variations and extensive customization options. Explore the settings panel when a block is selected to discover all available options for customizing appearance, behavior, and functionality.
